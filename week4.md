# Learning Journal: Prac 4 - Local Development & Deployment

# Process and Setup

1. Selection of Local Development Environment**:

   After researching various options, I decided to utilize XAMPP for my Windows-based setup. XAMPP provides an easy-to-install Apache distribution containing MySQL, PHP, and Perl, making it an ideal choice for running a local server.

2. Installing and Configuring XAMPP**:

   I downloaded and installed XAMPP from its official website. The installation process was straightforward. After installation, I started the Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP control panel to run the local server and database.

3. Setting up a Dynamic Site**:

   I chose WordPress as my CMS due to its user-friendly interface and wide range of features. I downloaded WordPress and placed it in the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP. I created a database for WordPress through phpMyAdmin and edited the `wp-config.php` file to configure the database settings.

4. Running and Testing the Site**:

   After completing the setup, I accessed the WordPress installation via `http://localhost/wordpress` in my browser. I followed the on-screen instructions to finalize the WordPress installation.

5. Customization and Plugin Installation:

   I explored various themes and plugins to enhance the functionality of the WordPress site. I installed a few plugins like Yoast SEO and Contact Form 7 to add more features to the site.

# Challenges and Learning Outcomes

- My experience with configuring XAMPP and integrating it with WordPress was both challenging and insightful, enhancing my understanding of the interaction between web servers and databases in a development environment. I encountered several issues during the installation, such as port conflicts, which significantly improved my problem-solving skills and deepened my knowledge of local server operations. Additionally, working with WordPress in a local setting provided a safe environment to experiment with theme customization and plugin functionalities, thereby increasing my familiarity with WordPress without the risks associated with a live site.

# Conclusion and Next Steps

This practical session was instrumental in familiarizing me with the concepts of local development and deployment. Going forward, I aim to delve deeper into more advanced aspects of WordPress, explore other CMS options for a broader perspective, and start experimenting with deployment techniques to transition from local development to a live server environment.

The next steps involve continuous learning and experimenting with different tools and technologies to streamline my local development process and deployment strategies. This practical exercise has been a valuable step in my journey towards becoming a proficient web developer.
