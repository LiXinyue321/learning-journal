# Reflecting on Prac 7 - PHP Web Development

As I embarked on Prac 7, the task was clear: to develop a series of PHP pages demonstrating specific programming skills for our project themed around James Cook University's Open Day. This practical exercise aimed to deepen our understanding of PHP by creating a website with dynamic content.

Working on this project, I first sketched out the structure and content for each page: Home, About, Blogs, Contact, and Course. Each page aimed to showcase different PHP functionalities such as echoing HTML, utilizing decision-making statements, repeating elements with loops, writing custom functions, and including common headers and footers.

The most enlightening part of this practical was integrating PHP with HTML to create dynamic, user-interactive pages. Using arrays and foreach loops, I could list upcoming events and courses dynamically, offering a glimpse into the vibrant life at JCU. Furthermore, implementing the 'include' function allowed me to maintain a consistent layout across the website, which was both efficient and effective in managing the content.

Encountering and overcoming various challenges, such as syntax errors and logical bugs, was a significant part of my learning curve. Each issue prompted me to delve deeper into PHP documentation and forums, enhancing my problem-solving skills and understanding of best practices in PHP development.
