### Learning Journal: Assessment Item 1 - Website Development/Creation
Task: Creation of Two Websites Using Different CMSs

### Objective: To design, create, and publish two similar websites for my startup business, each using a different CMS. This task aimed to enhance my understanding of web development using diverse content management technologies.

### Process of Website Creation Using Joomla and WordPress
CMS Selection: Chose Joomla and WordPress as my two CMS platforms. Joomla was selected for its flexibility and advanced customization options, while WordPress was chosen for its user-friendliness and wide range of themes.

### Initial Setup:

Joomla: Installed Joomla locally using a web server solution like XAMPP. Configured the basic settings and explored the Joomla control panel to familiarize myself with its interface.
WordPress: Similar to Joomla, installed WordPress locally. Spent time understanding the differences between Joomla and WordPress in terms of dashboard layout and functionality.
Theme Selection and Customization:

Joomla: Selected a theme that aligned with my startup's vision and branding. Spent considerable time customizing the theme, experimenting with different modules and layout options to match the aesthetic of the WordPress site.
WordPress: Chose a theme that offered a similar look and feel to the Joomla site. Customization in WordPress was more straightforward, with a focus on widgets and the customizer for tweaking the design.
Content Development and Migration:

Consistency Across Platforms: Ensured that both websites had a consistent tone and style. The content, including text, images, and videos, was carefully crafted to reflect my startup's message.
Joomla Site Content: Utilized Joomla's article and category management system to organize the content effectively. Experimented with different content types and layouts.
WordPress Site Content: Found WordPress to be more intuitive in terms of adding and managing content. Utilized the Gutenberg editor to create engaging layouts.
Plugin and Extension Integration:

Joomla: Explored various extensions to add unique functionalities that were not available in the base installation. This included SEO tools and custom contact forms.
WordPress: Installed plugins to enhance the site's capabilities, such as security plugins, SEO tools, and social media integration.
Testing and Refinement:

Conducted thorough testing on both sites to ensure functionality across different devices and browsers.
Made iterative improvements based on testing, focusing on user experience and site performance.

### Learning Outcomes:
This experience provided valuable insights into different CMSs, theme customization, and the integration of various media and functionalities. I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of clear, goal-driven website design, strategic content organization, and thoughtful information design.

### Reflections

This whole experience was a real eye-opener for me. I figured out just how crucial it is to place content smartly on a site. It's not just about dumping text and images; it's about making them work together to grab people's attention. Getting the goals right and having those calls-to-action were game-changers. They really guide people through the site. Also, documenting everything and reflecting on it – I didn't expect it, but this was super helpful. It's like it gives you a chance to step back and see the bigger picture of what you're learning and doing.

### Performance Evaluation

I'm pretty proud of how the websites turned out. Using Joomla and WordPress was challenging but worth it. I managed to get some cool plugins working which seriously upped the sites' game. The content feels spot-on – it's clear, makes sense, and is easy to navigate through. And the way I designed the sites? It's not just about looking good; it's about making it super easy for people to find what they need and take action. The effort I put into organizing the content and choosing the right images and text style really paid off.

### Next Steps

I'm keen on diving deeper into the advanced stuff these CMSs offer. And I know how important it is to see what users think, so I'm planning to get some feedback to make the sites even better. Keeping up with all the new web development tricks and tools is definitely on my to-do list. It's all about learning more and getting better at this.
