# Reflection

Setting up Slack, GitHub, and Trello was a learning curve, but seeing how they streamline communication and task management was enlightening. Slack keeps us connected, GitHub introduces me to version control, and Trello organizes our tasks visibly. The group agreement on Trello clarified our team roles and expectations, setting a collaborative tone. Though initially overwhelmed, I now appreciate how these tools integrate, making our project more manageable and efficient. I'm excited to further explore these tools and see how our project progresses with such solid groundwork.
