Prac 8 - A Comparative Study of Learning Techniques in Web Development for an Undergrad Student

Introduction:
As an undergraduate student in web development, I'm on a quest to discover the most effective learning methods. This week-long experiment is my attempt to compare active and passive learning strategies, with a focus on how they impact my understanding and skills in web development.

Learning Theory Hypothesis:
I believe that active learning, which involves direct engagement through coding and problem-solving, will lead to a deeper and more practical understanding of web development concepts compared to passive methods like reading or watching videos.

Methodology:
Duration: One week of focused learning sessions.
Learning Approaches:
Active Learning: Daily 4-hour sessions of practical web development tasks, including coding new features and debugging.
Passive Learning: Another 4 hours daily spent on theoretical learning, such as watching online courses and reading technical blogs.
Daily Routine:
Active sessions will be hands-on, like building WordPress features or solving PHP coding problems.
Passive sessions will involve learning similar topics theoretically.
Documentation:
Maintain a journal to record experiences, challenges, and learning progress with each method.
Evaluate the time needed for understanding, application, and retention of new concepts.
Evaluation:
Assess which method proves more effective in learning and retaining web development knowledge and skills.

Experiment Journal - Week 8:
Active Learning Days:
I was more engaged and connected with the material. Troubleshooting a WordPress plugin issue, for example, taught me more than any tutorial.
Applying concepts immediately helped solidify my understanding.
Passive Learning Days:
Tutorials and articles were informative but often failed to keep my attention or aid in long-term retention.
Concepts learned passively remained superficial in my understanding.
Outcomes:
Active learning sessions were significantly more beneficial for developing practical skills and in-depth knowledge.
Passive learning helped in gaining a broad view but was less effective in skill development.
Next Steps:
Incorporate more active learning into my study routine and use passive learning as a supportive tool.
Explore interactive learning resources like coding challenges and project-based learning platforms.

Personal Reflection:
This experiment shed light on my learning preferences and their effectiveness. As a future web developer, actively engaging with the material is essential for building practical skills. This experience will inform my educational approach, emphasizing hands-on practice to become a skilled web developer.
