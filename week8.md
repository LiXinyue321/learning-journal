# Week 8 Learning Journal

## Learning Activities & Resources

### Learning Experiment Design:
- **Hypothesis/Theory:** 
  - _Active learning, which involves hands-on activities like coding and problem-solving, leads to a deeper and more practical understanding of web development concepts compared to passive learning methods like reading or watching videos._

### Experiment Setup:
- **Active Learning (Test Group):**
  - Perform hands-on web development tasks for 4 hours daily, including building features in WordPress and debugging PHP code.
- **Passive Learning (Control Group):**
  - Spend 4 hours daily on theoretical learning, including watching online courses and reading technical blogs.

### Learning Activities:
- **Active Learning Activities:**
  - Creating WordPress themes and plugins.
  - Solving real coding challenges and debugging existing code.
- **Passive Learning Activities:**
  - Watching instructional videos on web development.
  - Reading articles and technical documentation about PHP and WordPress.

## Estimated Hours
- **Total Active Learning:** 20 hours over the week.
- **Total Passive Learning:** 20 hours over the week.

## Content Insights
- **From Active Learning:**
  - Gained practical skills in WordPress and PHP.
  - Improved understanding of web development through real-world application.
- **From Passive Learning:**
  - Broadened theoretical knowledge of web development topics.
  - Found difficulty in applying theoretical knowledge without practical context.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
- **Active Learning Reflections:**
  - Hands-on experience is crucial for developing employable skills in web development.
  - Active problem-solving enhances both understanding and retention of technical concepts.
- **Passive Learning Reflections:**
  - Theoretical knowledge is foundational but requires practical application to be fully grasped.
  - A mixed approach of theory followed by practice is more beneficial than passive learning alone.

## Reflection
- The experiment conducted this week provided valuable insights into my learning preferences and their effectiveness in acquiring web development skills. Active learning clearly stood out as a more effective method for understanding and retaining complex technical concepts. This hands-on approach not only facilitates deeper learning but also prepares me for real-world challenges in web development. The insights gained from this experiment will shape my future learning strategies, prioritizing practical experience while using theoretical learning as a supportive framework.
