Prac 8 - A Comparative Study of Learning Techniques in Web Development for an Undergrad Student

Learning Theory Hypothesis:
I believe that active learning, which involves direct engagement through coding and problem-solving, will lead to a deeper and more practical understanding of web development concepts compared to passive methods like reading or watching videos.

# Methodology:
Duration: One week of focused learning sessions.
# Learning Approaches:
Active Learning: Daily 4-hour sessions of practical web development tasks, including coding new features and debugging.
Passive Learning: Another 4 hours daily spent on theoretical learning, such as watching online courses and reading technical blogs.
# Daily Routine:
Active sessions will be hands-on, like building WordPress features or solving PHP coding problems.
Passive sessions will involve learning similar topics theoretically.
# Evaluation:
Assess which method proves more effective in learning and retaining web development knowledge and skills.

# Experiment Journal - Week 8:
Active Learning Insights:

Noticed a significant improvement in problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of complex web development concepts.
Direct application of concepts led to better retention and a more nuanced grasp of the subject matter.
Encountering and resolving real-time challenges enhanced my practical skills and confidence.
Passive Learning Insights:

Gained a broader overview of topics but lacked depth and practical application.
Found it challenging to retain and apply concepts learned passively in practical scenarios.
Passive learning proved beneficial for theoretical understanding but limited in developing practical skills.
Comparative Analysis and Conclusion:

The experiment clearly showed that active learning is more effective in developing practical web development skills.
While passive learning expanded my theoretical knowledge, it was less impactful without the reinforcement of practical application.
Future Learning Strategy:

Prioritize active learning in my educational approach, especially for hands-on fields like web development.
Use passive learning methods to supplement and support my active learning sessions.


# Reflection:
This experiment shed light on my learning preferences and their effectiveness. As a future web developer, actively engaging with the material is essential for building practical skills. This experience will inform my educational approach, emphasizing hands-on practice to become a skilled web developer.
