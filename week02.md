In this first week of practical work, I embarked on the journey of creating a Joomla-based website for our startup. The realization that I had not completed Practical 1ï¼ˆClaim my website goal clearly) reminder that staying on top of coursework is crucial. 

Website Name: TechInnovateHub

Target Audience: 
Start ups and technology innovators, Seeking Inspiration and Resources. Professionals interested in emerging technologies and entrepreneurial trends. Students and researchers should pay attention to the latest technological developments and innovative cases. Investors and industry leaders are seeking potential projects and talents. 

Website objective: To promote innovation and entrepreneurial spirit: To provide a platform to showcase the latest technological projects, stimulate innovative thinking and entrepreneurial spirit. Connect thought leaders and innovators: Create a community where innovators, industry experts, and potential investors can communicate and collaborate with each other. 

Practical Progress:

 To begin, I used the 1-click Joomla installer through a hosting provider to set up the Joomla CMS online. This allowed me to get started quickly, but I am aware that I'll need to set up a local development environment for more advanced work in the future. I focused on customizing the template to make our website look distinct from a default Joomla installation. This involved selecting a template that aligns with our startup's branding and making adjustments to its properties. I changed the color scheme, fonts, and layout to match our startup's identity. While keeping it simple for now, I added essential pages, text, and images that are relevant to our startup. It's important that our website communicates our mission and vision clearly.

Challenges Faced: Balancing practical work with other commitments can be challenging. I need to improve my time management skills to allocate sufficient time for coursework.
Plan for Next Week:

For the next week, I plan to continue refining the website's design and layout to align it more closely with our startup's brand and add more content to the website, including detailed information about our products or services.
